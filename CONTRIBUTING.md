## Contributing to Snse

Thank you for considering contributing to Snse. We appreciate your interest and support in making this project better. To ensure a smooth and collaborative development process, please take a moment to review our contribution guidelines.

### Trunk Based Development

We follow the Trunk Based Development (TBD) practices for our project. TBD is a development methodology that encourages continuous integration and short-lived feature branches. For more information, please visit [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com).

### Conventional Commit Messages

We use Conventional Commit messages for our commit messages to provide clear and consistent information about the changes being made. Conventional Commits help us generate changelogs automatically and maintain a clean commit history. For detailed guidelines and examples, please refer to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

#### Commit Message Format

Each commit message should adhere to the following format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Example:

```
feat(user-profile): add user profile component
```

### Unit Tests

Every change submitted as a pull request should include corresponding unit tests. These tests help ensure the stability and correctness of our project. Please make sure your changes are thoroughly tested.

### Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n)

Snse aims to be a globally accessible app. Contributions should consider internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) requirements. Ensure that text and UI elements are easily translatable and consider cultural differences when applicable.

### Branches and Issues/Tickets

We maintain a 1:1 relationship between branches and issues/tickets. For every branch created, there should be a corresponding issue or ticket, and vice versa. This practice helps us track and manage changes effectively.
